# Responsive Web Design Practice

 ## Live-Demo --> https://first-responsive-practice.netlify.app/
A responsive web design practice project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **SCSS**.  
This project focuses on creating a visually appealing, multi-section layout that scales smoothly across devices — from mobile screens to large 4K displays.  

Throughout this project, I explored how to build flexible layouts, control typography, and manage spacing using responsive CSS techniques.
